# Wikipedia citation needed checker

## by Casey Glidewell

This simple python program, run at the command line, will ping a requested wikipedia page once, and print out to the user how many instances of `[citation needed]` are present.

The user will then be prompted if they would like a report, and if confirmed, the program will also print the paragraphs that have the `[citation needed]` tag.

### To run

Execute scraper.py through python, then follow instructions.
